       "[{'answer': 'The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.'},\n",

Normally this wouldn\\'t matter, because you are supposed to buy and hold stocks, but they were buying what\\'s called \\'futures\\'. In a nutshell, they were buying contracts that afford them the legal right to purchase units of OJ at a specific price. Since they knew the price of OJ would fall (remember the dude with the locked briefcase?) they were buying option contracts to purchase OJ at a higher price. Anyone with half a brain would sell them these and of course that\\'s what happened. For in depth knowledge, look up \"how futures trading works.\"'},\n",

Spots in a commodity pit are protected like gang turf. They just go in and stand in the middle. Also if they deposit the cash from everyone's savings lets say 100k and the margin per contract is 5k per contract they can only buy or sell 20 contracts. I don't know what the FCOJ margins are, but if they trade more than 20 the profit goes to the exchange. At least that's how the CME rolls.\"},\n",

They should've bought very little contracts of fcoj which would sell out in 1min with that frenzy and then the buyers would go somewhere else and price would rise even beyond $1.42 2. They all look at the clock and then 9am (I think) strikes and crop report is read. Then they all panic because they need to unload whatever they bought and finding the 2 buying they sell ASAP. Again how can these 2 buy everything with so little money? 3. Finally the closing bell strikes and trading stops. How did all this scheme happen so fast ? Doesnt trading happen 9:30am to 4pm at NYSE (why wtc was shown?) for such commodities. Did they spend that many hours there? It just seemed sudden and abrupt the time flow.\"},\n",

In reality I think it would\\'ve been the firm that they trade through and that provided them the loan in the first place. (margin call means pay back the loaned amount) edit: maybe I had it backwards and the dukes were going to go long on OJ futures, but it\\'s the same principle. margin call did them in after the market worked against them based on their false knowledge.'},\n",
