0,Carbohydrate,"A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in other words, with the empirical formula (where m could be different from n).
Formerly the name ""carbohydrate"" was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula C (HO).
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type.
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be hydrolyzed handedness.
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms.
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for metabolism, being used both as an energy source ( glucose and in biosynthesis../..
Two joined monosaccharides are called a disaccharide and these are the simplest polysaccharides.
Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 3.87 calories of energy per gram for simple sugars, and 3.57 to 4.12 calories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods.
Nutritionists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex.
Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various biochemical processes responsible for the formation, breakdown and interconversion of carbohydrates in living organism s.The most important carbohydrate is glucose, a simple sugar ( monosaccharide that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms.
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to extract energy.
Carbohydrate chemistry is a large and economically important branch of organic chemistry.","['Structure', 'Division', 'Monosaccharides', 'Monosaccharides/Classification of monosaccharides', 'Monosaccharides/Ring-straight chain isomerism', 'Monosaccharides/Use in living organisms', 'Disaccharides', 'Nutrition', 'Nutrition/Classification', 'Metabolism', 'Metabolism/Catabolism', 'Carbohydrate chemistry']","A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in other words, with the empirical formula (where m could be different from n).

1,Flavor,"Flavor (or flavour; see spelling differences) is the sensory impression of food or other substance, and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell.
Flavorings are focused on altering the flavors of natural food product such as meats and vegetables, or creating flavor for food products that do not have the desired flavors such as candies and other snacks../..
While salt and sugar can technically be considered flavorants that enhance salty and sweet tastes, usually only compounds that enhance umami, as well as other secondary flavors are considered and referred to as taste flavorants.
The color of food can affect one's expectations of the flavor significantly.In one study, adding more red color to a drink increased the perceived sweetness with darker colored solutions being rated 2–10% better than lighter ones, even though it had 1% less sucrose concentration.
UK Food Law defines a natural flavor as:The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations describes a ""natural flavorant"" as:The European Union 's guidelines for natural flavorants are slightly different.
Food manufacturers are sometimes reluctant to inform consumers about the source and identity of flavor ingredients and whether they have been produced with the incorporation of substances such as animal by-products.
Food and beverage companies may require flavors for new products, product line extensions (e.g., low fat versions of existing products) or changes in formula or processing for existing products.

2,Human rights,"Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law.
Although ideas of rights and liberty have existed in some form for much of human history, there is agreement that the earlier conceptions do not closely resemble the modern conceptions of human rights.
The earliest conceptualization of human rights is credited to ideas about natural rights emanating from natural law../..
In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery../..
The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments../..
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification.
The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism.
Human rights can be classified and organized in several different ways.
The UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights.
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.
Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights : first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment).
In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms.
The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of Brownlie.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of World War II../..
In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.Since then numerous other treaties ( pieces of legislation have been offered at the international level.
In addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.
The Geneva Conventions came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross../..
Under the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international jurisdiction for universal human-rights legislation.
The United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorize the use of force.
The United Nations General Assembly, under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.Under this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments.
The United Nations Human Rights Council, created at the 2005 World Summit to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.The Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly and reports directly to it.
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of treaty-based bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties.
International human rights regimes are in several cases ""nested"" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements.
Human rights continue to be promoted around the world through governmental organizations and museums including the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba../..
International non-governmental human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Service for Human Rights and FIDH monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject.
A human rights defender is someone who, individually or with others, acts to promote or protect human rights.
Multinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and have been responsible for numerous human rights abuses.Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.
Human rights violations occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights).
The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being.
Throughout history, torture has been used as a method of political re-education and others.
In 1997, UNESCO adopted the Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation.
Sexual orientation and gender identity rights relate to the expression of sexual orientation and gender identity based on the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of ""other status"" as defined in various human rights conventions, such as article 17 and 26 in the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 8 and article 14 in the European Convention on Human Rights.As of 2011, homosexual behaviour is illegal in 76 countries and punishable by execution in seven countries.The criminalization of private, consensual, adult sexual relations, especially in countries where corporal or capital punishment is involved, is one of the primary concerns of LGBT human rights advocates.Other issues include: government recognition of same-sex relationships, LGBT adoption, sexual orientation and military service, immigration equality, anti-discrimination laws, hate crime laws regarding violence against LGBT people, sodomy laws, anti-lesbianism laws, and equal age of consent for same-sex activity.A global charter for sexual orientation and gender identity rights has been proposed in the form of the ' Yogyakarta Principles ', a set of 29 principles whose authors say they apply International Human Rights Law statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people's experience.The principles were presented at a United Nations event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay../..The principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, which focuses on ending violence, criminalization and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.The proposal was supported by 67 of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations, including all EU member states and the United States.
Although both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasize the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention free trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right.
The right to water has been recognized in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards.
Human rights include women’s rights and sexual and reproductive rights.
Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.
In October 2009, Finland announced that every person in Finland would have the legal right to Internet access.Since July 2010, the government has legally obligated telecommunications companies to offer broadband Internet access to every permanent residence and office.
Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
There are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system.
With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable), the UN recognizes that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – althoughRights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or jus cogens../..

Although ideas of rights and liberty have existed in some form for much of human history, there is agreement that the earlier conceptions do not closely resemble the modern conceptions of human rights.
The earliest conceptualization of human rights is credited to ideas about natural rights emanating from natural law../..
In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery../..
The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments../..
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification.
The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism.
Human rights can be classified and organized in several different ways.
The UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights.
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.
Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights : first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment).
In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms.
The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of Brownlie.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of World War II../..
In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.Since then numerous other treaties ( pieces of legislation have been offered at the international level.
In addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.
The Geneva Conventions came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross../..
Under the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international jurisdiction for universal human-rights legislation.
The United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorize the use of force.
The United Nations General Assembly, under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.Under this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments.
The United Nations Human Rights Council, created at the 2005 World Summit to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.The Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly and reports directly to it.
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of treaty-based bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties.
International human rights regimes are in several cases ""nested"" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements.
Human rights continue to be promoted around the world through governmental organizations and museums including the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba../..
International non-governmental human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Service for Human Rights and FIDH monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject.
A human rights defender is someone who, individually or with others, acts to promote or protect human rights.
Multinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and have been responsible for numerous human rights abuses.Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.
Human rights violations occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights).
The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being.
Throughout history, torture has been used as a method of political re-education and others.
In 1997, UNESCO adopted the Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation.

3,Photosynthesis,"Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation).
Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotroph s, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light.
In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membrane s. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.
In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron../..
In plants, light-dependent reaction s occur in the thylakoid membrane s of the chloroplast s where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH.
The NADPH is the main reducing agent produced by chloroplasts, which then goes on to provide a source of energetic electrons in other cellular reactions.
In the light-independent (or ""dark"") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin-Benson cycle, it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch.
In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss.
Cyanobacteria possess carboxysome s, which increase the concentration of around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis.
The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:
Plant s usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6%.Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) re-emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths.
Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules as electron donor s rather than water.
Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae.
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria../..
Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.
In 1893, Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light.
After WWII at late 1940 at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.
There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis and several corollary factors.
The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, with both time and space.In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity ( irradiance and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.

Cell signaling can be classified to be mechanical and biochemical based on the type of the signal.Mechanical signals are the forces exerted on the cell and the forces produced by the cell.
In a multicellular organism, signaling between cells occurs either through release into the extracellular space, divided in paracrine signaling (over short distances) and endocrine signaling (over long distances), or by direct contact, known as juxtacrine signaling../..
In some cases, receptor activation caused by ligand binding to a receptor is directly coupled to the cell's response to the ligand.
Molecular signaling can occur between different organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, the emitting organism produces the signaling molecule, secrete it into the environment, where it diffuses, and it is sensed or internalized by the receiving organism.","['Signaling between cells of one organism and multiple organisms', 'Classification', 'Cell signaling in multicellular organisms', 'Receptors for cell motility and differentiation', 'Signaling pathways', 'Intraspecies and interspecies signaling']","Cell signaling (cell signalling in British English) is part of a complex system of communication that governs basic activities of cells and coordinates cell actions.

Freshwater resident rainbow trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms.
The oceangoing (anadromous) form, including those returning for spawning, are known as steelhead in Canada and the U.S.
Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture.
The native range of is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the Aleutian Islands, throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico.
Since 1870, rainbow trout have been artificially propagated in fish hatcheries to restock streams and to introduce them into non-native waters.
Rainbow trout are commercially farmed in many countries throughout the world.
Populations of many rainbow trout subspecies, including anadromous forms (steelhead) of (coastal rainbow trout) and (Columbia River redband trout) have declined in their native ranges due to over-harvest, habitat loss, disease, invasive species, pollution and hybridization with other subspecies, and some introduced populations, once healthy, have declined for the same reasons.
Rainbow trout, primarily hatchery-raised fish of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies introduced into waters inhabited with cutthroat trout, will breed with cutthroats and produce fertile hybrids called cutbows. Whirling disease is a myxosporea n parasite of salmonids (salmon, trout, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations../..
Some fisheries are focused on removing rainbow trout in order to reestablish native trout populations.
Steelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes.

17,Old-growth forest,"An old-growth forest — also termed primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or (in Britain) ancient woodland — is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community.
Old-growth forests tend to have large trees and standing dead trees, multi-layered canopies with gaps that result from the deaths of individual trees, and coarse woody debris on the forest floor.Forest regenerated after a severe disturbance, such as wildfire, insect infestations or harvesting, is often called second-growth provide food sources and habitat for many types of organisms.
Fallen timber, or coarse woody debris, contributes carbon -rich organic matter directly to the soil, providing a substrate for moss es, fungi, and seedling s, and creating microhabitats by creating relief on the forest floor.
Intact soil s harbor many life-forms that rely on them.
Stand age can also be used to categorize forest as old-growth.
From a forest dynamics perspective, old-growth forest is a forest in a stage that follows Understory Reinitiation stage.
Common cultural definitions and common denominators regarding what comprises old-growth forest, and of the variables that define, constitute and embody old-growth forests include: The forest habitat possesses relatively mature, old trees; The old-growth tree s have long continuity on the same site; The forest itself has not been subjected to significant inhabitation by mankind that has altered the appearance of the landscape and its ecosystem s, has not been subjected to logging, and has inherently progressed per natural tendencies.
Old-growth forests were often given harvesting priority because they have the most commercially valuable timber, they are considered to be at greater risk of deterioration through root rot or insect infestation, and they occupy land that could be used for more productive second-growth stands.
A 2001 scientific symposium in Canada found that defining old growth in a scientifically meaningful, yet policy-relevant, manner presents some basic difficulties, especially if a simple, unambiguous, and rigorous scientific definition is sought. Old-growth forests often contain rich communities of plant s and animal s within the habitat due to the long period of forest stability.
Old-growth forests provide ecosystem services that may be far more important to society than their use as a source of raw materials.
The effects of old-growth forests in relation to Global Warming has been contested in various studies and journals.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its 2007 report : “In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.”Critics note that at old-growth forests are often perceived to be in equilibrium, but could be releasing as much carbon dioxide as they capture, or are currently in a state of decay.
According to the World Resources Institute, as of January 2009, only 21% of the original old-growth forests that once existed on earth are remaining.
The increased understanding of forest dynamics in the late 20th century has led the scientific community to identify a need to inventory, understand, manage and conserve representative examples of old-growth forests with their associated characteristics and values.
